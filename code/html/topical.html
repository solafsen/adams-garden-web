                <p>

                    We chose the mobile smartphone as our piece of modern technology. Some barriers
                    are related to the design of the mobile phone. These include battery life, 
                    screen and text size and the complexity and cost of the device. Some barriers 
                    are related to functionality. These could be the cost and accessibility of data, 
                    the time consumption and stress related to this and fear of theft or damage to 
                    the phone or loss of personal information

                <h2> Solutions to the barriers and how they can benefit Carlos</h2>

                <p> 

                    As a taxi driver, Carlos is constantly on the go and does not have regular
                    access to electricity for charging his phone. He has difficulties seeing 
                    the screen with normal text size and finds it hard to navigate on the smartphone 
                    without traditional buttons. Even though Carlos is hard working, he does 
                    not have a high income compared to western standards. The cost of buying a 
                    mobile phone device is significant, and the data cost comes in addition. 
                    The internet access in Cuba is limited, thus the functionality and usage of 
                    the mobile phone is reduced in this area. Carlos is stressed about using too 
                    much data, as the cost could be too much for him to handle. He is also scared 
                    of being unreachable if something happens with his family or friends. 
                    Since the mobile phone is such an expensive device, Carlos is worried he might 
                    damage or lose his phone (due to theft or misplacement) and what might happen 
                    to his personal data whenever this occurs. 
                    
                </p>
            
                <p>	  

                    Carlos has difficulties maneuvering 
                    his phone, but he also has the option to increase text size to see the text more 
                    clearly and he could also utilize the screen reader and voice recognition features
                    to reduce touch screen activity. If Nikolao Tesla vision 
                    <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=954901" target="_blank">
                    <em> (Vujic et al., 2001)</em></a> of free, unlimited access to wireless electricity
                    all over the world was implemented, several of Carlos`s problems regarding his 
                    mobile phone would be solved, especially stress and cost related to phone charging
                    and internet accessibility. To combat the problem of expensive phones, we propose 
                    a recycling solution where “old” discarded phones from developed countries are fixed 
                    and utilized in poorer populations like in Cuba, so the expenses of buying a mobile
                    phone will be reduced significantly. With a cheaper phone, Carlos is not as stressed 
                    with losing or damaging it, so he can focus more on keeping his wife happy. To reduce 
                    his fear of losing personal data, Carlos could for instance take a course in data 
                    security and change his password from “Yolanda” to “y0L@nDa1970T3@Mo” and make sure
                    to change it quite frequently
